Those two notes aim to show that the unity and interconnection of economics(, and hopefully can be extended to other fields, not limited within economics, as well).  The only way to show it is by providing a maybe loose but still coherent perspective to view as many fields of economics as possible.  

The motivation of this series is my personal belief about the inevitability of touching different fields for understanding the society around us. I regard economics as a subject focusing on *behavior rules of agent(s) in certain environments, the counter-factual behavior rules of agent(s) if the environment where they lived in is altered, and the consequences*. 

Consequently, it is necessary to set up the environment and choose the agents before telling stories. And the hopelessness of analyzing reality as a whole makes it inevitable to sharpen minds by narrowing it down using a *model*. 

The art of economics is that there is no unique way of setting up the model, while the science part of economics is to use logic (usually done by mathematical language) to ensure assumptions-consistent conclusions and apply statistical methods to real-world data to test the model-implied conclusions so that the whole model is, in principle, falsifiable.

*A note on economic modeling* describes the building blocks of economic models, and organizes examples from different economic fields in a hopefully coherent way to show how to use those building blocks.

*A retrospect of economic stories* discusses the implications and message that one can by doing such exercise, organized by topics.
